<h1>How can we solve the problem of inequality withinin Califronia public education?</h1>
<p>In order to solve this problem, we need to have more information on it. Luckily, all the data we need
has already been collected, we just need it consolidated and analyzed.<br> The PPP is requesting that the
California Department of Education and the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration create a
database similar to the spreadsheet<br> we have made. This new database should display:<br>
Total revenue for each school  district<br>
Revenue per student for each school district<br>
Median income of households within each school district <br>
Relvant student achievment scores for each district<br>
Percent of students in district who attend UC's, CSU's or CCC's<br>
